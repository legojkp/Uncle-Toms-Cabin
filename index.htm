<h1><center>Summary of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i></center></h1>
<p1><center>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
The story begins with a discussion between Haley, the slave trader, and 
Mr. Shelby. They discuss the trade of two slaves, Uncle Tom and a boy named Harry;
in return, this deal will settle the mortgage that Haley has found. If Mr. Shelby 
doesn't make this trade, then he will lose possession of his land and his property. 
While this occurs, Eliza, who is the mother of Harry, notices the trader and worries
about Mr. Shelby selling Harry. However, when she asks Mrs. Shelby about it, Mrs. 
Shelby promises her this would never happen. Uncle Tom is then introduced as the scene 
changes to Uncle Tom's Cabin. During this time when the cook Aunt Chloe is making dinner
for Tom and the children, Mr. Shelby agrees to and signs the papers releasing him from
his debt and releasing Tom and Harry from his control. That evening, Mr. Shelby informs 
Mrs. Shelby of the deal he had made. Mrs. Shelby desperately tries to negotiate a 
different trade, especially because they had already promised Uncle Tom his freedom, and 
because Harry is beloved by the Shelby's. Eliza, Harry's mother, overhears this conversation 
and flees with Harry.

When Haley arrives to pick up Tom and Harry, he immediately confronts Mr. Shelby 
about Eliza's escape. He begins to prepare to pursue Eliza. Mrs. Shelby, who is
hoping that Eliza can successfully escape, orders Sam, one of the slaves, to accompany 
Haley on the road. She especially cautions them not to ride too fast. Sam already 
knows that Mrs. Shelby wants Eliza to escape, so he hid a beechnut under the saddle 
of Haley's horse. He brings the horses to Haley, but when Haley mounts his horse it 
throws him off because of the beechnut. Sam takes a long time to round up the horses,
which wastes time and allows Haley to stay for lunch before the journey. By the time 
he embarks on his task to find Eliza, it is around two o'clock. During this time, Eliza 
has reached the Ohio River, which is the border between the South and the North, and she 
is trying to find a way across the half-frozen waterway.

Upon Haley's arrival at the town by the Ohio River, Sam sees Eliza and allows his hat 
to blow off, letting him give an inconspicuous warning shout to Eliza. She grabs Harry 
and traverses across the frozen chunks of ice. A man on the other side, who Eliza 
recognizes as Mr. Symmes, helps her up and points her to a house where she can get 
help. Haley, who saw Eliza cross the river but is unable to cross himself, pays a man 
named Tom Loker to hunt down Eliza and Harry. A deal is made so that, if the slaves are 
caught, then Loker and his partner Marks will keep Eliza. Sam and Andy, the two slaves 
who accompanied Haley, returned to the Shelby house before the deal was made, so they 
are uninformed, and thus are only able to inform the Shelby's of Eliza's escape and not 
of the coming hunt. Haley returns to the Shelby's home to collect Tom. As Haley goes 
to the blacksmith's for Tom's handcuffs, Master George, Mr. Shelby's son, tells 
Uncle Tom that when he grows older, he will save Uncle Tom.

George Harris, Eliza's husband who had escaped from a neighboring farm just a day before 
Eliza herself, is seen walking into an inn under the name of Henry Butler. He meets with 
his former employee Mr. Wilson and informs him that George is a free man and is escaping 
to a place where he can be free. He asks Mr. Wilson to give a pin to Eliza, not knowing 
that she herself has run away. Meanwhile, Haley and Tom make their way to the slave market, 
where Haley buys several more slaves, then they board a ship heading further south, and 
they travel down the Mississippi river, joined by other travelers and workers. Eliza 
has continued her journey to a Quaker settlement, where they learn that she is the wife of 
George Harris. The two are later reunited at the settlement. While Uncle Tom is travelling 
down the Mississippi river, he meets a girl namd Eva St. Clare. She later falls off the side 
of the boat and Uncle Tom jumps in and saves her. St. Clare, who is thankful for Uncle Tom,
buys Tom from Haley and puts him in charge of driving the family's coach. During this time, 
we learn about the background of the St. Clare family, particularly about Augustine St. 
Clare and his wife Marie.

Eliza and George plan to reach Canada, but a Quaker named Phineas warns them that Tom Loker 
and his group plan to come for them. They leave and set up a camp in a small place with 
limited accessibility. If Tom Loker comes for them, they will only be able to enter the 
camp through one entrance. They arrive, and George says he will shoot any man that enters 
the camp. Tom Loker tries to enter the camp and get wounded in his side. The rest retreat, 
but Eliza takes pity on Loker and so the Quakers will cary him to another Quaker household 
to heal him. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom becomes trusted enough to handle the finances in his 
master's household. Miss Ophelia, the cousin of Augustine St. Clare, attempts to add 
a sense of efficiency to the household.

The St. Clare family discovers that a slave named Prue has been whipped to death by her 
master. Miss. Ophelia accuses St. Clare of supporting slavery. St. Clare later buys a 
young slave named Topsy, who is to be taught by Ophelia. Topsy would not listen to 
Ophelia, but responded when Eva showed kindness to Topsy. Two years pass, Tom gets a letter 
from Master George about life in Kentucky. Tom becomes close with Eva. One day during the 
summer, she says she's seen angels' the family worries when they notice Eva has gotten
 thinner. Eva spends time with Henrique, her cousin, when he visits with his father Alfred. 
Henrique strikes his slave and Eva makes him promise that he love the slave, and Henrique 
agrees.

When Eva's health begins to fail, she wants her father to free all the slaves if she dies. 
St. Clare promises to free Tom, but he says he will try to free the rest of the slaves 
as well. When Eva does die, St. Clare is so deep in mourning that he is incapable of 
believing in God and in the glory of heaven. But then Tom prays for St. Clare, and he hears 
Tom pray and his faith is restored. St, Clare goes to a café, but is stabbed when there 
is a fight between two drunken men. He soon dies and, with his early death, was unable 
to make the arrangements to free the slaves. Marie send all the slaves to a slave 
warehouse, and Uncle Tom is sold to a man named Simon Legree, along with a slave named 
Emmeline and two other men. On the plantation, slaves treat the other slaves cruelly, 
and Tom's faith falters until he sees a vision on Eva. When he sees a fellow slave struggling 
he helps them. Overseers report this detail of cooperation back to Legree, who tries to force
Tom to whip the woman he helped. He refuses and is nearly beaten to death. A slave named 
Cassy tries to heal Tom and tells him that he should give up; there is no God. She later 
tells Legree to leave Tom alone, but instead he threatens Tom after Tom refuses to get 
down on his knees and beg for Legree to pardon him.

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Cassy makes Legree believe that ghosts are haunting a part of the house, then she and 
Emmeline attempt to escape the plantation. When the overseers order the household to 
hunt for them, they sneak back into the "haunted" part of the house where they have 
stocked a supply of food. Legree and others would not go to investate that part of the 
house, and any noises that where made from that part of the house were assumed to be 
the ghosts. Legree is furious, and he takes it out on Tom, saying he would kill Tom if 
Tom didn't tell Legree what he knew about the escape. When Tom says he would rather die, 
Legree beats Tom all night, then orders the overseers to continue to beat Tom. After two 
days, George Shelby arrives at the plantation hoping to find Tom. Tom is on the brink of 
death but, after seeing Master George, dies a content death. George Shelby threatens to 
try Legree for murder, but since no whites saw the beating, the case could not proceed. 
George turned and struck Legree with an indignant blow. George took Tom's body and buried 
him outside the borders of the plantation, promising to do what he could to drive the 
curse of slavery from the land.

<h2><center><strong>Uncle Tom</strong></center></h2>
<p1><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Uncle Tom is a large, broad-chested African American man. He is Mr.
Shelby's best hand. Mr. Shelby trusts Tom so much that he lets Tom travel alone
and do business in place of Mr. Shelby. When asked why he doesn't run away to
Canada, Tom answers "master trusted me, and I couldn't." His freedom had been
discussed with the Shelby's, but they were forced to sell him to the trader
named Haley. Mr. Shelby describes Uncle Tom as "steady, honest, [and] capable."
Uncle Tom is a very faithful man and even prays under the worst conditions, 
especially when his beliefs in God are threatened by Simon Legree. 
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p1>
<h3><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Mr. Shelby</strong></center></h3>
<p2><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Mr. Shelby is the owner of Uncle Tom and of many other slaves. He is forced to
sell two of his slaves, one of which is Uncle Tom and the other is a boy named
Harry, because the trader Haley came into possession of a mortgage. Mr. Shelby 
must either sell Uncle Tom, or he would lose all his possessions. Mr. Shelby 
had discussed and promised Tom his freedom, but is now forced to sell him to Haley.
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p2>
<h4><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Eliza</strong></center></h4>
<p3><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Eliza is the mother of Harry, who is the other slave that Mr. Shelby was forced
to sell to Haley. She is married to a slave named George, who is a slave on a 
neighboring estate. She overheard the discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Shelby
about the slaves. She takes Harry with her and runs away from the estate in 
hopes to escape up to Canada. She is able to make her escape across the Ohio 
river on patches of ice. "I saw her, with my own eyes, a crossin' on the 
floatin' ice."
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p3>
<h5><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Haley</strong></center></h5>
<p4><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Haley is the slave trader who buys Uncle Tom and Harry from Mr. Shelby. He is
described as a short, thick-set man who was in the habit of flourishing and 
jingling a heavy gold watch chain. He puts priority in his trade and money-making,
which is indicated by the fact that he is forcing Mr. Shelby to sell some of his
slaves to pay for the mortgage Haley acquired. He is, as described in the beginning,
not a gentleman. This is demonstrated by his temper and attitude throughout the
novel. "Haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously."
He tries to present himself as someone who treats slaves well but he often mistreats
his slaves violently. 
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p4>
<h6><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Eva St. Clare</strong></center></h6>
<p5><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Eva St. Clare is a young girl who is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. She is very 
shy, but has a busy interest in everything going on. She had a golden head and deep 
blue eyes. She sees no difference between black and white, and she asks her father 
to buy Uncle Tom so that he will be happy. She becomes a very important person in 
Uncle Tom's life. She dies at a young age, and asks her father to free Uncle Tom 
when she dies. 
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p5>
<h7><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Augustine St. Clare</strong></center></h7>
<p6><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Augustine St. Clare, the father of Eva, is a graceful, elegantly formed young man with 
the same golden-brown hair, large blue eyes, and noble cast of head as Eva. He was good-
humored, and when Eva asked him to buy Tom for any price, he did. He is a man that, 
like Mr. Shelby, believes that slavery is wrong, but he still tolerates and participates 
in it. Eva makes him promise to free all the slaves if she dies, but Augustine dies soon 
after Eva and his wife Marie sells all the slaves to a slave warehouse. 
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</p6>
<h8><font size = "+2"><strong><center>Simon Legree</strong></center></h8>
<p7><font size = "+1.5">
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
Simon Legree is the plantation owner who buys Uncle Tom from the slave warehouse. He 
was a violent, hateful, and evil master. He rejected all religions and would not tolerate 
any religion on his plantation. Legree wants to destroy Tom's religious faith, but when 
Tom is killed loving the man who killed him, his faith, in the end, was more powerful 
than the evil Legree brought. Legree's treatment of slaves was an image of slavery at 
its worst.
